Starting with an intro to variables, I want to explain how you can use a very simple counter to your Power Automate flow.
Let’s say you have an Apply to each, like 5 entries, and after this you email your client with the combined data from those 5 entries.

Add the following steps:

- On top of your flow, add an Initialize Variable
- Choose a name
- Select Type Integer
- Leave Initial value blank (or select a starting count)
- In your Apply to each, add an Increment Variable (Increment means to add/change the count)
- Increment the variable you’ve created on top with 1 in the value.

Add the variable after your Apply to each step wherever you want, and it will give you the count.
